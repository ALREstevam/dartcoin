          <p>Dart Coin (DRTC or DRT$) is a currency launched in 2024, it's indexed by the amount of mess Dart, the dog,
            makes—typically, more mess means the value goes up compared to the real. Meanwhile, when we have a calm
            Dart, the value tends to drop.</p>
          <p>
            Market events like "stole clothes from the laundry basket," "jumped on the table and grabbed food," or "took
            something and is dodging everyone trying to catch it" are not uncommon, and they make this currency quite
            volatile—some might even call it chaotic.</p>
          <p>
            Dart, who has a solid career of less than one year as a professional parkour puppy, decided to dive into the
            currency exchange market and create his own currency.
          </p>
          <p>
            The exchange from Dart Coin and BRL is managed by Dart himself, who backs it with various assets he's hiding
            under the bed, like stolen socks, flip-flops, shoes, dog treats, and any random object he manages to bite.
            These assets are overseen by the former fund supervisor, <a href="images/luke.png" target="_blank">Luke</a>, ex Samsung CEO.
